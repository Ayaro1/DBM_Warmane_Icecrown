Added Features

- Integrated the addon CL_Fix made by Gmad (Gjeneth @ Warmane - Outland)
  This stops the combatlog from bugging out so often.
  Also means that you don't need to load that addon seperately
  
  
General Modifications

- Details! backport support made possible by Ajseward.
- Changed update download link to https://github.com/Ayaro1/DBM_Warmane_Icecrown
- Added the "/dbm rel" command to broadcast version check results to raid chat instead of self
  This function requires you to be promoted in raid to avoid spam
  This does not (yet) work for party chat
  - Removed the whisper part of this function to avoid the Warmane chat silence and make it less "spammy"
- Set the update notification to enabled by default
  This does not appear to override settings with the notification disabled but works for fresh installs of this edited DBM
- Added the ElvUI main texture to DBM and set it to default
  If you have ElvUI installed, you might see this texture twice in the dropdown list when choosing another texture
- Set the default size of the small bars to 207
- Removed some code that was edited out to reduce file size and RAM load
- Added a LFG cooldown timer after successfully entering LFG - Made by Underlord from Sunwell
 - Temporarily disabled


Bosstimer Fixes

Raids

- Icecrown Citadel

 - Lord Marrowgar Heroic
  - Fixed Bone Spike timers
  - Fixed Bone Storm timer
  - Fixed Bone Storm cooldown timer
  - Added "Spikes up in..." timer for when Bone Spikes is being cast
    This acts as a secondary timer next to the cooldown timer
  - Added vocal anouncement when Bone Spikes are being cast

 - Lady Deathwhisper Heroic
  - Fixed heroic mode timers by breaking normal mode
  - Adjusted adds spawn timers to be more accurate
  - Adjusted the first Dominate Mind timer to be more accurate
   - Further adjusted the first Dominate Mind timer as of 5.06
    Ability is being used anywhere between 40 and 48 seconds so use it as a cooldown reset timer
  - Added the option to enable automatic removal of Mark/Gift of the Wild after 24 seconds of combat
    The 24 second delay is so that the buff is still active during first trinket uptime and first wave of adds
    This option is enabled by default for dps and healers, but disabled for tanks
  - Added vocal anouncement when boss casts Vengefull Shades

 - Gunship Battle Heroic
  - Fixed combat start timer for Alliance side
   - Alliance and Horde side use the same timer, yet Horde side starts combat 2 seconds earlier
  - Fixed the Battle Mage timer on Alliance side
  - Hopefully fixed the Battle Mage timer on Horde side

 - Deathbringer Saurfang Heroic
  - Fixed combat start timer for the first pull on Alliance side
    Alliance and Horde have seperate code
    I don't play Horde side so that's not getting fixed anytime soon unless someone is willing to provide data
  - Fixed the timer for the first set of Bloodbeasts
  - Added vocal anouncement when boss summons Bloodbeasts

 - Rotface Heroic
  - Fixed Vile Gas timer
  - Fixed Poison Slime Pipes timer

   - As of version 4.71 these have been turned off for healers

 - Sindragosa Heroic
  - Set the Range Check to always use Heroic Mode values (20) regardless of difficulty (20 yards on Heroic, 10 yards on Normal)
  - Added a raidchat notification "Gained_Instability" when casters/healers gain a stack of Instability (Unchained Magic)
   - As of version 4.71 this notification doesn't start untill the caster has 4 stacks to reduce the chat spam
     This still causes "a little" chat spam depending on what stage of the fight you're in and what tactic you use
     - As of 5.01 this has been disabled completely
  - Added a raidchat notification "Instability_Reset" when casters/healers drop their stacks of Instability (Unchained Magic)

    - Reverting this change with 4.72
     - As of 5.01 this has been disabled completely

  - Added vocal anouncement when you are affected by Necrotic Plague
  - Fixed the first phase 3 Defile timer


- Ruby Sanctum
 - General Zarithrian
  - Adjusted Fear timer to be more accurate
    First fear seems to be a bit random

    First summon adds seems to be a bit random

  - Added vocal anouncement when boss casts Meteor

- Trial of the Crusader

 - Northrend Beasts
  - Gormok the Impaler
   - Fixed combat start timer

  - Acidmaw & Dreadscale
   - Fixed combat start timer
   - Adjusted submerge timer to be more accurate, improvements still needed
     Hard cooldown for submerge is 45 seconds, but new timer doesn't trigger untill after worms come up and use a special ability
     Special abilities are being used between 3-5 seconds after the worm comes up again
   - Adjusted emerge timer to be more accurate
     This seems random at best and may as well be removed completely so it stops being annoying

  - Icehowl
   - Fixed timer for Icehowls first Massive Crash
   - Added a seperate timer for the second Massive Crash in case the original timer from DBM doesn't trigger
     It's possible to have two timers up for the second Massive Crash if and when the original timer triggers but that's better than having none
	 
 - Lord Jaraxxus
  - Fixed combat start timer for the first pull
  - Nether Power timers fix and warnings by Nimloth/Lothe @ Warmane Icecrown
  - Fixed timers for Nether Volcano's
  - Fixed timer for the first Nether Portal
  - Added a seperate timer with warning for the second Nether Portal since the original timer does not activate after the first portal spawns

 - Anub'Arak
  - Added a seperate timer, warning and special warning for the second submerge since the original does not reactivate after the first burrow
  - Added extra timers for the first and second emerge since the triggers for that are unstable
    The way they're scheduled might cause the "2nd Emerge" timer to start running while you're already in the final phase of Anub
    However this is only just a timer bar so it shouldn't clutter your screen too much and it beats having nothing


- Ulduar

 - Razorscale
  - Fixed enrage timer

 - Freya
  - Added /say anouncement for people affected by Iron Roots saying "Rooted"
   - Removed due to bad coding on my part causing way to much spam

To do

General

- Fix version check result broadcast on party chat
- Create ingame option to enable/disable flashing of the DBM timer bars

Raids

- Icecrown Citadel

 - Festergut
  - Fix Malleable Goo timers

 - Blood Prince Council
  - Add timer for role play on the first pull
  - Fix Empowered Shockwave timers

    This is gonna be a challenge and possibly impossible
    In order for DBM to pick up the AURA_APPLIED combatlog message, the aura has to be applied after the boss spawns
    Quite often the boss spawns with the aura already applied so there's nothing for DBM to pick up in the combatlog
